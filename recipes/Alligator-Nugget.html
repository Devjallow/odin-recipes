            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Pour fish fry mix into a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag. Add alligator nuggets, reseal the bag, and shake to coat. Let stand for 5 minutes. Shake the bag again.
                </li>
                <li>Place half of seasoned alligator nuggets in the deep fryer. Cook until golden brown and nuggets float to the top of the oil, about 3 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Using tongs, transfer nuggets to a paper-towel lined plate.</li>
